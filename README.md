# Predicting-Revnue-for-United-Airlines
Time Series Project in R

# Objective: 
The goal is to study and implement the algorithms in order to forecast the future operating revenue for the ‘United Airlines’ using Time Series methodologies and deriving an optimal solution to help them in decision making for better revenue generation in future.

# Background Information: 
United Airlines, Inc. (commonly referred to as United) is a major American airline company and is the 3rd largest Airline in the world. It operates a large domestic and international route network spanning city large and small across the United States and all six continents. It’s revenue for the year 2019 was 43.26 billion USD (as per ‘benzinga news’).

# Problem Statement: 
We will be considering the quarterly revenue of ‘United Airlines’ from 2000 to 2020 (2nd Quarter) for forecasting the revenue for the years 2020 and 2021 on a quarterly basis. The idea is to forecast the future revenue for the years 2020 and 2021.
